# PacMan
A very slow, laggy, and overall not very good version off pacman I created with python and pygame.

The movement logic for the ghosts was done with if-elsif statements instead of with a pathfinding
algorithim (I hadn't thought of using one at the time). Overall slightly dissappointed, but not too
much. I had fun making this.
there is an easter egg when pac man's center touches the middle of the bottom of the screen.

None of the original art, music, or font is mine.
